# SpookyProject
Small project I've been working on. While it is planned to be a complete game in the near future, its primary use is to let me experiment freely with new systems
on an already established codebase.

## Current focuses
- Composition over inheritance
- Modular code, dividing game into separable parts
- Physics-based puzzles
- Quest system using [SUQS](https://github.com/sinbad/SUQS)
- Save system using [SPUD](https://github.com/sinbad/SPUD)
